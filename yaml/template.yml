title: "Coding Principles"
content:
  - name: "SOLID / Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)"
    description: "A class should have only one reason to change. This ensures that a class addresses only one concern, making the system more modular and easier to maintain."
  - name: "SOLID / Open/Closed Principle (OCP)"
    description: "Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This allows adding new features without altering existing code."
  - name: "SOLID / Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)"
    description: "Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. This ensures that a derived class is truly an extension of the base class."
  - name: "SOLID / Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)"
    description: "Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This makes the system more modular and easier to understand."
  - name: "SOLID / Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)"
    description: "High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. This decouples software modules."
  - name: "Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)"
    description: "Every piece of knowledge or logic should exist in a single place. This reduces repetition and potential errors."
  - name: "Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)"
    description: "Systems work best when kept simple. Avoid unnecessary complexity."
  - name: "You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)"
    description: "Avoid adding functionality until it's necessary. Prevents over-engineering."
  - name: "Law of Demeter (Principle of Least Knowledge)"
    description: "An object should only communicate with its immediate neighbors. This leads to a more decoupled system."
  - name: "Separation of Concerns"
    description: "Different functionalities should be separated into distinct sections or modules. This makes the system more modular."
