      The SOLID principles are a set of design principles in object-oriented programming that enable developers to
      create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software. Here's a deeper dive into each of these
      principles.

      In summary, the SOLID principles are crucial for any developer aiming to create scalable, efficient, and
      maintainable software. By adhering to these principles, you can reduce bugs, improve code readability, and
      make your software easier to extend and maintain. While these principles might seem complex initially, their
      benefits in a professional software development environment are immense.

  Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

      content: Overview
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        The Single Responsibility Principle asserts that a class should have one, and only one, reason to
        change. This means a class should only have one job or responsibility. The idea here is to organize the
        code in a way that each class addresses a single concern or functionality.

      content: |
        By adhering to SRP, code becomes more robust. It's easier to debug because changes are isolated to the
        specific part of the code responsible for the feature. It also enhances readability, as each class has a
        clear purpose.

      content: |
        In practice, if you find a class performing multiple tasks like data access, business logic, and data
        validation, it's time to consider refactoring. Each of these tasks should be a separate class.
    - variant: h6
      content: Example
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        Consider a class ReportGenerator. If it's handling both data retrieval and report generation, it
        violates SRP. Instead, have one class for data retrieval (DataRetriever) and another for report
        generation (ReportBuilder).
    - variant: h6
      content: Conclusion
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        SRP is fundamental in minimizing the impact of changes. When a class is responsible for one thing,
        changes in that aspect of the application should only affect that class.
  Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
    - variant: h6
      content: Overview
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be
        open for extension but closed for modification. This means a class's behavior can be extended without
        modifying its source code.
    - variant: h6
      content: Benefits
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        OCP is critical for reducing the risk of breaking existing functionality when implementing new features.
        It promotes the use of interfaces and abstract classes to allow behaviors to be extended.
    - variant: h6
      content: Implementation
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        One way to implement OCP is by using abstract classes or interfaces. These can be extended by other
        classes to add new functionality without changing the original class's code.
    - variant: h6
      content: Example
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        Imagine a <Code>PaymentProcessor</Code> class. Instead of modifying it for each payment method, you can
        create an interface <Code>IPaymentMethod</Code> and then extend it for <Code>CreditCardPayment</Code>,
        <Code>PaypalPayment</Code>, etc.
    - variant: h6
      content: Conclusion
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        OCP helps in building scalable systems where new functionalities can be added with minimal changes to
        existing code, reducing the likelihood of introducing bugs in already-tested code.
  Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
    - variant: h6
      content: Overview
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        The Liskov Substitution Principle demands that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects
        of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. Essentially, subclasses should be
        substitutable for their base classes.
    - variant: h6
      content: Benefits
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        LSP ensures that a subclass can stand in for its superclass. This principle is crucial for ensuring that
        a system remains robust when faced with subclassing, as it guarantees that a subclass does not alter
        expected behavior.
    - variant: h6
      content: Implementation
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        To follow LSP, ensure that subclasses fulfill the promises made by their base class. This means they
        should not remove base class functionality and should not introduce side effects that are not present in
        the base class.
    - variant: h6
      content: Example
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        If you have a Bird class with a method fly(), a subclass Penguin should not implement fly() in a way
        that throws an error or does nothing, as penguins can't fly. Instead, consider restructuring the
        hierarchy.
    - variant: h6
      content: Conclusion
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        LSP is fundamental in inheritance-based architectures. It ensures that subclasses maintain the expected
        behavior, leading to more reliable and easy-to-maintain code.
  Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
    - variant: h6
      content: Overview
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        The Interface Segregation Principle emphasizes that no client should be forced to depend on methods it
        does not use. This principle advocates for creating specific interfaces rather than one general-purpose
        interface.
    - variant: h6
      content: Benefits
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        ISP leads to a more organized codebase. It reduces the side effects of changes in the interface and
        makes the codebase more adaptable and easier to refactor.
    - variant: h6
      content: Implementation
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        Instead of one large interface, multiple smaller, more specific interfaces should be used. Clients will
        only need to know about the methods that are of interest to them.
    - variant: h6
      content: Example
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        Imagine an interface IWorker with methods work() and eat(). Not all workers might need eat(). In this
        case, it's better to have two interfaces, IWorkable and IEatable, and classes can implement these as
        needed.
    - variant: h6
      content: Conclusion
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        ISP helps in building flexible systems that can evolve over time without unnecessary dependencies or
        forced implementations, leading to cleaner, more modular code.
  Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
    - variant: h6
      content: Overview
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        The Dependency Inversion Principle is about decoupling software modules. It states that high-level
        modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Also, abstractions
        should not depend on details, but details should depend on abstractions.
    - variant: h6
      content: Benefits
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        DIP reduces the direct coupling between high-level and low-level modules, making the system more robust
        and less prone to breakage when individual components are modified or replaced.
    - variant: h6
      content: Implementation
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        Implement DIP by using interfaces or abstract classes to create a layer of abstraction between different
        modules. High-level modules interact with these abstractions rather than directly with low-level modules
    - variant: h6
      content: Example
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        Consider a high-level module OrderProcessor that needs to save data using a Database. Instead of
        directly using a specific database class, OrderProcessor should depend on an IDatabase interface, which
        can be implemented by any specific database class.
    - variant: h6
      content: Conclusion
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        DIP is a powerful principle for achieving loose coupling and greater modularity in a software system,
        leading to code that is more maintainable and flexible.
