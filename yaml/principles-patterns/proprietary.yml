      The SOLID principles are a set of design principles in object-oriented programming that enable developers to
      create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software. Here's a deeper dive into each of these
      principles.
accordion:
  DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):

      content: |
        DRY is a fundamental principle in software development that emphasizes the importance of avoiding
        duplication in code. The idea is to have a single, authoritative representation of every piece of
        knowledge and logic in the system.

        By following DRY, you reduce the likelihood of inconsistencies and bugs because changes only need to be
        made in one place. It also makes the codebase easier to maintain and understand.

        Implement DRY by identifying patterns and repeated code blocks. Then refactor these into functions,
        classes, or modules that can be reused.

      content: Example

      content: |
        Suppose you have several functions that validate user input. Instead of repeating the validation logic
        in each function, create a single validateInput function and call it wherever validation is needed.

        Adhering to DRY helps in building a cleaner, more efficient, and error-resistant codebase. It's about
        maximizing the impact of code changes while minimizing the effort.
  KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):
    - variant: h6
      content: Overview
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        KISS advocates for simplicity in design. It suggests that systems work best if they are kept simple
        rather than made complex. Therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary
        complexity should be avoided.

      content: |
        Simpler code is easier to understand, test, and maintain. It often leads to fewer bugs and improves
        collaboration as more team members can understand and contribute to the codebase.

      content: |
        To keep things simple, always look for the most straightforward solution. Avoid over-engineering and
        adding unnecessary features or layers.
    - variant: h6
      content: Example
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        When designing a function to calculate the area of a rectangle, stick to the basic formula (length *
        width). Resist the urge to add unrelated features, like logging or input validation, to the function.
    - variant: h6
      content: Conclusion
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        KISS is about the elegance and power of simplicity. In a world where complexity is often seen as
        sophistication, KISS reminds us that simple solutions are often the best.
  YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):
    - variant: h6
      content: Overview
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        YAGNI is a principle of extreme programming that states a programmer should not add functionality until
        deemed necessary. It's a caution against over-engineering.
    - variant: h6
      content: Benefits
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        Following YAGNI can save time and resources, and help keep the software product lean and focused. It
        avoids the burden of maintaining unused code.
    - variant: h6
      content: Implementation
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        When developing, always question the necessity of each feature. Add something only when it's immediately
        needed, not just because it might be needed in the future.
    - variant: h6
      content: Example
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        If you're building a website and think, "I might need a user forum in the future," resist the urge to
        implement it now. Wait until it's clear that a forum is necessary.
    - variant: h6
      content: Conclusion
    - variant: subtitle1
      content: |
        YAGNI is a reminder to stay focused on the present requirements and avoid getting sidetracked by
        features and functionalities that might never be needed.
