description: |
  A key technology of the World Wide Web, JavaScript is an essential language for front-end web development,
  enabling interactive web pages. It's also used in server-side development (Node.js, Deno, and Bun). As a multi-paradigm language,
  it supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has dynamic typing and supports object-oriented programming.
  JavaScript has seen significant evolution since its inception, particularly with the introduction of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) in 2015,
  which brought major syntactic improvements and features like classes, modules, arrow functions, and template literals.
