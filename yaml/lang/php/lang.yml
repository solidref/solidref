  PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development.
  It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1995 and has since become one of the most widely used languages for server-side development.
  PHP code is executed on the server, and the result is returned to the client as plain HTML. The language is known for its ease of use and
  ability to be embedded directly within HTML code. PHP offers a wide range of functionality for web development, including database interaction,
  session management, and data encryption. It's used in the development of content management systems (CMS), e-commerce platforms, and web applications.
  PHP has a large and active community, contributing to its continuous evolution and the addition of modern features to meet the changing demands of web development.
