  Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Designed by Guido van Rossum and first
  released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant
  whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code
  for small and large-scale projects. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple
  programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming.
  Python is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and
  system scripting. The extensive standard library, large ecosystem of third-party packages, and active community
  make Python a popular choice among programmers worldwide.
