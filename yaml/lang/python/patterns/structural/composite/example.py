"""
The Department interface in Python is represented as a base class with method declarations. 

IndividualDepartment and CompositeDepartment inherit from Department. IndividualDepartment represents a leaf in the composite structure, 
while CompositeDepartment can contain other departments, enabling the construction of a composite tree structure.

This Python version maintains the logic and comments of the original example, 
illustrating how a composite design pattern can be implemented in Python.
