  C# is a versatile, multi-paradigm programming language developed by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative.
  Designed to be simple yet powerful, C# is widely used for developing desktop applications, web applications (via ASP.NET),
  and more recently, mobile applications through Xamarin. Since its inception, C# has evolved significantly, with C# 7.0 and
  above introducing features that enhance the language's functionality and developer productivity. These features include tuples
  for grouping data, pattern matching for more expressive conditionals, local functions for better encapsulation, and
  async/await for asynchronous programming. With the introduction of .NET Core and .NET 5+, C# has become a cross-platform
  language, running on Linux and macOS in addition to Windows. C# 8.0 introduced nullable reference types to improve code safety,
  and C# 9.0 introduced records for immutable data structures, making it an attractive choice for modern software development
  practices that emphasize safety, performance, and reliability.
