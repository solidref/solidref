description: |
  Java is a widely used object-oriented programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.
  It follows the Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) principle, meaning that Java code compiled on one platform can run on any platform
  that supports Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are compiled to bytecode, which can run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
  Java is used in a variety of computing platforms, from embedded devices and mobile phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers.
  Java's syntax is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities. Java is designed to be easy to use and is widely taught in
  educational institutions as an introductory programming language. It is also known for its strong security features, portability, and an extensive standard library
  (the Java Standard Edition (SE) API). Over the years, Java has evolved to support functional programming features such as lambda expressions and streams.
  The language's architecture-neutral and garbage-collected environment, along with its robustness and scalability, have made it a popular choice for building
  enterprise-level applications, Android apps, and large systems.
