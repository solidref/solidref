description: |
  C++ is a highly versatile and powerful programming language that extends the C programming language.
  Created by Bjarne Stroustrup, it was designed for system and application software, high-performance server and client applications,
  and software engineering. C++ offers both high-level object-oriented programming features and low-level memory manipulation capabilities,
  making it suitable for developing operating systems, game engines, desktop apps, and much more. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
  including procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming. C++ is known for its efficiency and performance, which is why it's widely used
  in developing applications where performance is critical. Over the years, C++ has evolved significantly with the introduction of the Standard Template Library (STL),
  modern syntax features, and improvements in performance and usability through its various versions (C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, and the upcoming C++23).
  Despite its steep learning curve, C++ remains a foundational language that is crucial for systems programming, game development, and performance-critical applications.
