  C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming,
  lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations.
  Developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs, C was originally designed for writing system software
  like operating systems, compilers, and editors. It has since become one of the most widely used
  programming languages. C is an efficient and powerful language, known for its performance and
  control over system resources. Despite its age, C remains popular for both system-level and
  application programming, forming the basis for more modern languages like C++, C#, and Objective-C.
  It's also commonly used in embedded systems, operating systems like Linux and Windows, and complex
  applications requiring high performance. The languageâ€™s influence is evident in numerous other
  programming languages and it remains a fundamental part of software development history.
