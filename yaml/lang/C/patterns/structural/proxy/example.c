/**
 * The IHttpServer struct defines the common behavior for both the HttpServer and the ProxyServer through function pointers.
 * The HttpServer represents the real HTTP server implementation. It implements the request function
 * to simulate sending HTTP requests to the actual server.
 * The ProxyServer struct acts as a proxy server. It intercepts requests before forwarding them to the real
 * server. The ProxyServer_request function performs additional tasks such as logging, caching, or access
 * control before delegating the request to the real server.
 * In the main function, we instantiate a ProxyServer struct and send a request to it. The proxy intercepts
 * the request, performs any necessary processing, and then forwards the request to the real server.
 * Finally, it returns the response to the client.
