  Go, often referred to as Golang, is an open-source programming language developed at Google.
  It is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and reliable concurrency handling. Go is statically
  typed, compiled, and syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection,
  structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency features. It's widely used in cloud and network
  services, command-line tools, and web applications. A notable feature of Go is its efficient
  handling of concurrent operations, making it a popular choice for building high-performance
  applications. Go's design is focused on simplicity and readability, which has led to its wide
  adoption in software engineering for scalable server-side applications. The language has a
  strong standard library, robust tooling, and a rapidly growing ecosystem.
