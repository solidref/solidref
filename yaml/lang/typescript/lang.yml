  TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language.
  It was developed by Microsoft and is widely used for building large-scale applications,
  particularly in the realm of web development. TypeScript compiles to plain JavaScript and can be
  used in both front-end and back-end development. It offers features like static typing,
  interfaces, generics, and advanced tooling support through tools like Visual Studio Code.
  TypeScript provides developers with increased type safety and helps catch errors at compile time,
  leading to more robust and maintainable codebases.
