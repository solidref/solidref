Go is statically\ntyped, compiled, and syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection,\nstructural typing, and CSP-style concurrency features. It's widely used in cloud and network\nservices, command-line tools, and web applications. A notable feature of Go is its efficient\nhandling of concurrent operations, making it a popular choice for building high-performance\napplications. Go's design is focused on simplicity and readability, which has led to its wide\nadoption in software engineering for scalable server-side applications. The language has a\nstrong standard library, robust tooling, and a rapidly growing ecosystem.\n"},{"name":"JavaScript (ECMAScript)","code":"javascript","birth":1995,"death":"N/A","inspiredBy":["awk","hypertalk","java","perl","python","self","scheme"],"inspiring":["typescript","coffeescript","dart","elm"],"description":"A key technology of the World Wide Web, JavaScript is an essential language for front-end web development,\nenabling interactive web pages. It's also used in server-side development (Node.js, Deno, and Bun). As a multi-paradigm language,\nit supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has dynamic typing and supports object-oriented programming.\nJavaScript has seen significant evolution since its inception, particularly with the introduction of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) in 2015,\nwhich brought major syntactic improvements and features like classes, modules, arrow functions, and template literals.\n"}]
