Since its inception, C# has evolved significantly, with C# 7.0 and\nabove introducing features that enhance the language's functionality and developer productivity. These features include tuples\nfor grouping data, pattern matching for more expressive conditionals, local functions for better encapsulation, and\nasync/await for asynchronous programming. With the introduction of .NET Core and .NET 5+, C# has become a cross-platform\nlanguage, running on Linux and macOS in addition to Windows. C# 8.0 introduced nullable reference types to improve code safety,\nand C# 9.0 introduced records for immutable data structures, making it an attractive choice for modern software development\npractices that emphasize safety, performance, and reliability.\n"},{"name":"TypeScript","code":"typescript","birth":2012,"death":"N/A","inspiredBy":["javascript","c#","java","php","python","ruby","scala"],"inspiring":["javascript"],"description":"TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language.\nIt was developed by Microsoft and is widely used for building large-scale applications,\nparticularly in the realm of web development. TypeScript compiles to plain JavaScript and can be\nused in both front-end and back-end development. It offers features like static typing,\ninterfaces, generics, and advanced tooling support through tools like Visual Studio Code.\nTypeScript provides developers with increased type safety and helps catch errors at compile time,\nleading to more robust and maintainable codebases.\n"},{"name":"Go (Golang)","code":"go","birth":2009,"death":"N/A","inspiredBy":["c","oberon","pascal","limbo","python","alef"],"inspiring":["rust","nim","crystal"],"description":"Go, often referred to as Golang, is an open-source programming language developed at Google.\nIt is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and reliable concurrency handling. Go is statically\ntyped, compiled, and syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection,\nstructural typing, and CSP-style concurrency features. It's widely used in cloud and network\nservices, command-line tools, and web applications. A notable feature of Go is its efficient\nhandling of concurrent operations, making it a popular choice for building high-performance\napplications. Go's design is focused on simplicity and readability, which has led to its wide\nadoption in software engineering for scalable server-side applications. The language has a\nstrong standard library, robust tooling, and a rapidly growing ecosystem.\n"},{"name":"JavaScript (ECMAScript)","code":"javascript","birth":1995,"death":"N/A","inspiredBy":["awk","hypertalk","java","perl","python","self","scheme"],"inspiring":["typescript","coffeescript","dart","elm"],"description":"A key technology of the World Wide Web, JavaScript is an essential language for front-end web development,\nenabling interactive web pages.
